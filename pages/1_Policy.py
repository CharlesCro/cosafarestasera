We **do not**:
- Sell or rent your data

## 6. Data Storage and Retention

We store only minimal authentication data (e.g., your Google user ID and email) for as long as your account remains active.

## 8. International Data Transfers

As we are based in the European Union, your data is stored and processed within the EU whenever possible.  
If data is transferred outside the EU (e.g., to Google servers), it is protected under **appropriate safeguards** such as **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** or equivalent protections approved by the European Commission.
